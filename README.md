## Background Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Packages:

Using:

- [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom) for routing.
- [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) for internationalization, Dutch and English.
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styling.
- [react-snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot) for static site generation.
- [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for the icons.
- [Snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io/) for svg animation.

To name just a few.

And on the back-end:

- [nginx](https://nginx.org/) As front-facing server.
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)

### Content Management

As CMS I use [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)

### Inspiration:

- [Annual report brochure on geometric and spots background](http://all-free-download.com/free-vector/download/annual-report-brochure-on-geometric-and-spots-background_6823285.html)
- [Flyer template design with modern style](http://all-free-download.com/free-vector/download/flyer_template_design_with_modern_style_6824365.html)
- [Inspiration for Button Styles and Effects](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/02/26/inspiration-button-styles-effects/)

### Other

To be able to use I had to eject from Create React App as the timing function used by Snap.svg, mina, needs to be globally loaded. Therefore a webpack modification is needed.
Still, Snap.svg is the best free package for this task, especially for morphing as this is quite a complex task.
